# CPU Usage Monitoring and Visualization

This project contains two main scripts: `Capture.sh` and `linuxPerformanceParser.py`.

## Description

`Capture.sh` is a bash script that monitors the CPU usage of a specified process over a given duration and logs the data. The `linuxPerformanceParser.py` script reads the generated log files, parses the data, and creates a plot of CPU usage over time.

## Files

1. `Capture.sh`: This bash script monitors the CPU usage of a specified process and logs the data. It takes one argument: the duration of monitoring in minutes. The script also zips and deletes the original log files after monitoring is complete.

2. `linuxPerformanceParser.py`: This Python script reads the log files generated by `Capture.sh`, parses the data into a pandas DataFrame, and creates a plot of CPU usage over time for each log file.

## Requirements

- Bash shell
- Python 3
- Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib

## Usage

1. Run `Capture.sh` with the duration of monitoring as an argument. For example, to monitor for 10 minutes, use: `./Capture.sh 10`.
2. Run `linuxPerformanceParser.py` to generate the plots: `python3 linuxPerformanceParser.py`.
